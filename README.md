Number guessing game
This Python program generates a random number between one and one hundred and asks the user to guess it. The program will tell the user whether their guess is too high or too low, and it will keep track of how many guesses the user made before finding the right answer.
To utilize the program, you want to have Python introduced on your PC. Python is available for download from the official website. You can run the program in google collab or Vs code.
Outside of Python itself, the program does not have any requirements or dependencies.
The code has a main function that uses the random module to generate a random number and then uses the input() function to ask the user to guess the number. After that, the program starts a loop that goes on until the user guesses the right number. The program displays the message "Too low, try again" if the user's guess is too low. and asks the user to re-guess. The program will exit if the user's guess is too high.
